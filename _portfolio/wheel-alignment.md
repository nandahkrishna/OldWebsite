I was part of a team working on an industrial project on automatic wheel alignment. Stereo images of wheels were provided, and the goal was to develop a program that calculated the distance of the wheel's center from the cameras and the wheel's angles of tilt. The program was written in C++ and OpenCV was used for image processing techniques.
Current status: Working on distance and angle calculation.
