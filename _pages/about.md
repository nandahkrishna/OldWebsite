I'm Nanda, an undergraduate student of Computer Science and Engineering. I'm interested in the fields of Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Applied CS. I especially love the application of CS in solving inter-disciplinary problems. My aim is to carry out research in these fields, and also teach and spread CS knowledge to everyone. <br> <br>
